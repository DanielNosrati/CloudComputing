CS 5412 Cloud Computing Project

## Deploy to EC2 Quick
Welcome to the world of automation. Get ready to be blown away :) 

To get started we must install `Vagrant` [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/)

With vagrant installed: check success of installation with `vagrant help`

Next, you will install `ansible` which can be done with this command: `sudo pip install ansible`

Now you are ready to have some fun! Follow these steps exactly to deploy and test your app:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/CornellNLP/CS4300_Flask_template.git
$ cd CS4300_Flask_template
$ cd vagrant
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant provision
...
TASK [Make sure nginx is running] **********************************************
ok: [default] => {"changed": false, "name": "nginx", "state": "started"}

RUNNING HANDLER [restart nginx] ************************************************
changed: [default] => {"changed": true, "name": "nginx", "state": "started"}

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
default                    : ok=16   changed=12   unreachable=0    failed=0
```

Now navigate to `http://192.168.33.10/` and you will see the app loaded up!

Let's deploy this AWS now! 

First step is to launch an EC2 instance (on the Oregon Availability Zone)

This EC2 instance should be using `Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type - ami-7c22b41c` as an AMI. 
This AMI will be the same type of OS that we used for our VM.

I would recommend that you choose the `t2.micro`, which is a small, free tier-eligible instance type. 

Make your security group one with these configs:

| Ports | Protocol | Source          |
|:-----:|:--------:|-----------------|
|   80  |    tcp   | 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0 |
|   22  |    tcp   | 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0 |
| 443   |    tcp   | 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0 |

After, launching download the the key-pair and name it `cloudcomputing`. 

Place the `cloudcomputing.pem` inside the vagrant folder. 

Ensure, that your vagrant folder looks like this:

```bash
$ ls
Vagrantfile     cloudcomputing.pem   ansible.cfg     cs.nginx.j2     hosts           site.yml        upstart.conf.j2
$ chmod 700 cloudcomputing.pem
```

Your next step will be to take the public IP found when clicking on your instance in the EC2 terminal under: `IPv4 Public IP`
and putting that into the hosts file. So the hosts file should look like this, with <YOUR_PUBLIC_IP> being replaced by that `IPv4 Public IP` value:

```yml
[webservers]
 <YOUR_PUBLIC_IP> ansible_ssh_user=ubuntu
```

Insure that you had the the private key by running `ssh-keygen`:

```bash
$ ssh-keygen 
enerating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
...
```

After this you are ready to push have an automated script push to your EC2 instance, just execute this:

```bash
$ ansible -m ping webservers --private-key=cloudcomputing.pem --inventory=hosts --user=ubuntu
<YOUR_PUBLIC_IP> | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
$ ansible-playbook -v site.yml
...

Boom! You are done :) How easy was that!
